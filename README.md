# Cargo Distribution System

In this project, which is called Cargo Distribution System, it is aimed to create a smart cargo distribution system. Login to the program is provided with a user name and password. Google Maps API, where we will show the addresses of the cargoes on the map, has been included, and a database has been created on the FireBase platform, where the cargoes and user information are kept. It is aimed to ensure that the courier who distributes cargo on the map can reach the starting position and the cargo locations shown on the map and return to the original location by using the shortest path algorithm.
